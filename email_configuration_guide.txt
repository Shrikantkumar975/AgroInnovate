AgroInnovate Email Configuration Guide
=====================================

When you need to update email credentials in the future, you'll need to modify two files:

1. File: includes/functions.php
   Location: Line ~696 in the sendEmail() function
   What to change:
   - $mail->Username = 'your-new-email@gmail.com'
   - $mail->Password = 'your-new-app-password'

2. File: contact.php
   Location: Line ~34 in the form processing section
   What to change:
   - $adminEmail = 'your-new-email@gmail.com'
   
   Also update the displayed email in the contact information section (around line ~90):
   - <p>your-new-email@gmail.com</p>

Steps to Generate a New Gmail App Password:
